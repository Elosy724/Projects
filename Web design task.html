<h1><u>Artificial Intelligence</u><h1>
<p><strong>AI,</strong>or<strong><i>Artificial Intelligence,</i></strong> <font color="red">is a branch of computer science</font><font color="blue">that focuses on</br>
creating systems that can perform tasks that would normally require human levels of intelligence.</font><bold>AI is a wide discipline with numerous subfields, each with unique </br> objectives and specilizations.</bold></br></br>AI can be categorized into three levels based on its capabilities:</p>

<h2><span style="background-color:yellow;"><font color="blue"><bold> Difference between Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Data Science</bold></font></span></h2>
<p><ol type="starting from 1">
<li><strong> Artificial Intelligence</strong> refers to a computer systems that can behave intelligently, reason</br> and learn like humans.</li></br>
<li><strong> Machine Learning</strong> is a subset of artificial intelligence focused on developing </br> algorithms with the ability to learn without explicity being programmed</li></br>
<li><strong>Deep Learning</strong> is a subset of machine learning whose algorithms are inspired by the</br> brain's structure and work exceptionally well with unstructured data such as images,</br> videos, or text</li></br>
<li><strong>Data Science</strong> is a cross-disciplinary field that uses all of the above, amongst other</br> skills like <strong> data analysis,</strong> statistics, data visualization, and more, to get insight from data.</li></br>
